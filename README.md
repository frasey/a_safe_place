# a_safe_place

Using Dart, Flutter and Firebase I worked in a team of three to create an app designed to help with organisation and inspired to support neurodivergent people, or those with memory issues.


## The Project
I had the idea for this project based on my own organisational needs. My calendar is full of reminders, to the extent that it can be hard to see free time. I also get a little anxious about re-occuring events that have quite a long space of time, such as annual MOT, insurance, medical appointments etc. This app is intended to replace the safe place that items so often go missing in. 

It currently still a work in progress, but will a place to store reminders, appointments and recurring events along with any documents attributed to these all in one place. The interface is designed to be minimal, so that a user can avoid information overwhelm, but can easily see their upcoming events or search for an event in various ways for peace of mind.

As an additional support, users can add primary and secondary tags to their saved items. A primary tage will give the event card a colour, so you could easily spot eg, medical appointments vs insurance. There is also an option for secondary tags. These also have their own colour, and can have their own shape, so that a user can see at a glance more specific appointments such as medical: hospital vs medical: GP. With this system users should be able to find a way of marking their stored items in a way that best makes sense to them.

As security for personal information was a priority, we ensured to have an authentication page for this app, so that user information will remain private.


## What would I do differently or like to keep working on
We had two weeks for this project, and in retrospect I would dedicate more time to learning the Flutter framework. I feel I had a much better understanding of Dart than Flutter, which made things a little more complicated when integrating the database and managing data flow. 

This app is still a work in progress, and ideally I would like to make it available online as I would like to use it myself. Still to complete:
- Google authentication
- Ability to upload images and documents
- Upcoming event rendering on home page
- Light/dark theme
- Final database corrections
- Notifications
- Recurring events
